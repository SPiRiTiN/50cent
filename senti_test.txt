the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new  conan and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger jean-claud van damme or steven segal
the gorgeously elaborate continuation of  the lord of the rings trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe cowriterdirector peter jacksons expanded vision of j r r tolkiens middleearth
effective but too-tepid biopic
if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun wasabi is a good place to start
emerges as something rare an issue movie thats so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one
the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics even those who have reached the absolute top of the game
offers that rare combination of entertainment and education
perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions
steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges its so clever you want to hate it but he somehow pulls it off
take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema
this is a film well worth seeing talking and singing heads and all
what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness
simplistic silly and tedious
its so laddish and juvenile only teenage boys could possibly find it funny
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable
discards the potential for pathological study exhuming instead the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification
the story is also as unoriginal as they come already having been recycled more times than id care to count
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audiences meat grinder one more time
not so much farcical as sour
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore free allusions to the serial murders but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject
a sentimental mess that never rings true
while the performances are often engaging this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary
interesting but not compelling
